# PKSPS
PKSPS: a novel method for predicting kinase-specific phosphorylation sites combined with protein-protein interaction information and local sequence information.
# Requirement
```
numpy>=1.14.5
pandas>=1.0.3
networkx>=2.5
```
# InstInstall 
python 3.6 in Linux and Windows.<br>
Since the program is written in python 3.6, python 3.6 with pip tool must be installed first. PKSPS uses the following dependencies: numpy, pandas, networkx, and random. You can install these packages first, by the following commands:<br>
```python
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install networkx
pip install random
```
# Running PKSPS
Open cmd in windows or terminal in Linux, then download all the data and code in PKSPS-master to the local address, cd to where the code and data are stored and run:
```
python predict.py
```
